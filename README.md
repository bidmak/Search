# Google Search Front-End

## Overview

This project involves creating a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search, mimicking the appearance and functionality of Google's search pages.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main HTML files:
- `index.html`: For regular Google Search.
- `images.html`: For Google Image Search.
- `advanced.html`: For Google Advanced Search.

Additionally, there may be supporting CSS files and any other assets that contribute to the styling and functionality of the pages.

## Running the Application

1. Open the HTML files in a web browser of your choice.
   - For example, right-click on `index.html`, then choose "Open with" and select your preferred browser.

2. Explore the functionality on each page:
   - **Google Search Page (`index.html`):**
